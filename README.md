## Classical conditioning benchmarks for state construction
This repository provides the benchmarks inspired by classical conditioning for state construction presented in **Paper** [From eye-blinks to state construction: Diagnostic benchmarks for online representation learning](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10597123221085039) and **PhD Thesis** [State Construction in Reinforcement Learning](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=thesis).
